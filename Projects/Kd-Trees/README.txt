Kd-Tree (2d-Tree in this instance, easily adjustable).

A data type to represent a set of points in the unit square (all points have x- and y-coordinates between 0 and 1) using a 2d-tree to support efficient range search (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle in with order of growth O(logN)) and nearest neighbor search (find a closest point to a query point with the same order of growth as for range search). 2d-trees have numerous applications, ranging from classifying astronomical objects to computer animation to speeding up neural networks to mining data to image retrieval.

Auxiliary classes.


Point2D

The Point class is an immutable data type to encapsulate a two-dimensional point with real-value coordinates.

API

public class Point2D implements Comparable<Point2D> {
   public Point2D(double x, double y)              // construct the point (x, y)
   public  double x()                              // x-coordinate 
   public  double y()                              // y-coordinate 
   public  double distanceTo(Point2D that)         // Euclidean distance between two points 
   public  double distanceSquaredTo(Point2D that)  // square of Euclidean distance between two points 
   public     int compareTo(Point2D that)          // for use in an ordered symbol table 
   public boolean equals(Object that)              // does this point equal that object? 
   public    void draw()                           // draw to standard draw 
   public  String toString()                       // string representation 
}


RectHV

The RectHV class is an immutable data type to encapsulate a two-dimensional axis-aligned rectagle with real-value coordinates. The rectangle is closedâ€”it includes the points on the boundary.

API

public class RectHV {
   public    RectHV(double xmin, double ymin,      // construct the rectangle [xmin, xmax] x [ymin, ymax] 
                    double xmax, double ymax)      // throw a java.lang.IllegalArgumentException if (xmin > xmax) or (ymin > ymax)
   public  double xmin()                           // minimum x-coordinate of rectangle 
   public  double ymin()                           // minimum y-coordinate of rectangle 
   public  double xmax()                           // maximum x-coordinate of rectangle 
   public  double ymax()                           // maximum y-coordinate of rectangle 
   public boolean contains(Point2D p)              // does this rectangle contain the point p (either inside or on boundary)? 
   public boolean intersects(RectHV that)          // does this rectangle intersect that rectangle (at one or more points)? 
   public  double distanceTo(Point2D p)            // Euclidean distance from point p to closest point in rectangle 
   public  double distanceSquaredTo(Point2D p)     // square of Euclidean distance from point p to closest point in rectangle 
   public boolean equals(Object that)              // does this rectangle equal that object? 
   public    void draw()                           // draw to standard draw 
   public  String toString()                       // string representation 
}


PointSET

A brute force data type PointSET.java that represents a set of points in the unit square. Implement using a red-black BST.

API

public class PointSET {
   public         PointSET()                               // construct an empty set of points 
   public           boolean isEmpty()                      // is the set empty? 
   public               int size()                         // number of points in the set 
   public              void insert(Point2D p)              // add the point to the set (if it is not already in the set)
   public           boolean contains(Point2D p)            // does the set contain point p? 
   public              void draw()                         // draw all points to standard draw 
   public Iterable<Point2D> range(RectHV rect)             // all points that are inside the rectangle 
   public           Point2D nearest(Point2D p)             // a nearest neighbor in the set to point p; null if the set is empty 

   public static void main(String[] args)                  // unit testing of the methods (optional) 
}
