8 Puzzle



The problem. 

The 8-puzzle problem is a puzzle invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s. It is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square blocks labeled 1 through 8 and a blank square. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks so that they are in order, using as few moves as possible. You are permitted to slide blocks horizontally or vertically into the blank square.



Board

Organize the program by creating an immutable data type Board

API

public class Board {
    public Board(int[][] blocks)           // construct a board from an N-by-N array of blocks
                                           // (where blocks[i][j] = block in row i, column j)
    public int dimension()                 // board dimension N
    public int hamming()                   // number of blocks out of place
    public int manhattan()                 // sum of Manhattan distances between blocks and goal
    public boolean isGoal()                // is this board the goal board?
    public Board twin()                    // a board that is obtained by exchanging any pair of blocks
    public boolean equals(Object y)        // does this board equal y?
    public Iterable<Board> neighbors()     // all neighboring boards
    public String toString()               // string representation of this board (in the output format specified below)

    public static void main(String[] args) // unit tests (not graded)
}



Solver

An 8-puzzle Solver using the Board class

API

public class Solver {
    public Solver(Board initial)           // find a solution to the initial board (using the A* algorithm)
    public boolean isSolvable()            // is the initial board solvable?
    public int moves()                     // min number of moves to solve initial board; -1 if unsolvable
    public Iterable<Board> solution()      // sequence of boards in a shortest solution; null if unsolvable
    public static void main(String[] args) // solve a slider puzzle (given below)
}
